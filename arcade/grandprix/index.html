<div style="text-align: left;">This
site is dedicated to the documentation of supplemental information to
restore a EM race car game. I acquired the game non-working and badly damaged from a barn<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br>
</div>
<br>First on the list was the crash unit, my game was mostly functional
with the major exception that someone had removed the crash relay,
because of this the game would not crash basically making it boring. I
sourced a new relay from online sources for 50-70$ this was crazy and I
was not going to pay these prices. The problem is that the relay is a
high impedance and the DPDT layout is very abnormal layout. So rather
then correct the part, I decided to replace it with a cheaper 5v relay.
I should also add that I have seen multiple versions of this exact game
and they all have the crash relay melted so I assume that the original
spec was incorrect and the game was commonly damaged here.<br><br>The
CdS sensors all seem to ohm out and work ok but the game didnt crash,
so I replaced a capacitor that was out of spec on the crash detection
PCB and also replaced the transistors with 2n2222 NPN transistors
because of this change to more common transistors I also added a final
PNP transistor to throw the 5v relay to cause the crash unit to work.
this also meant that I needed to rewire the original crash relay to the
new 5v DPDT relay. Additionally I had to add 10k to the trim pot for
the sensitivity on the crashing. For added help I added a LED to the
last NPN transistor to visually see when the relay should be clicking
to help in circut testing. You see this problem all stems from the
issue that with the voltage system they have on this circut we only
have about 5ma of power at 11 volts or so to switch the relay, so after
the transistors are done I had to use a 5v relay to make sure it clicks
off. When dialed in the game plays factory original.<br><br>The Game
had no glass in it, the Frosted glass, mirror and tempered glass were
all broken out. Even my main graphic wheel was damaged. This is because
at some point the game fell off a trailer I guess.<br>New glass was
super easy to source at a local glass shop. cost was $150 parts list is
as follows. 20.25X26.75 1/8th Clear Tempered glass, 26.5X28.5 1/8th
Mirror, 26X21 1/8th Satin Etch. These three sheets fit in the original
mounting for my game with no issues at all. This was the the only money
I really put into the game to restore it.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><br></div>
